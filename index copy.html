            <h1>My name is Taylor Oenick, and I am a UI/UX Designer specializing in visual design. </h1>
            <p>I enjoy solving digital problems with intuitive and impactful design thinking and processes. </p>
            <p> I believe I can bring something different to the table than most traditional designers, because of my background in Civil & Environmental Engineering, Sustainable Design and Art.</p>
            <p>Good design, much like a well-engineered bridge or a compelling painting, asks "how can I extend beyond function, and into beauty?"</p> 
            <p>Design, at its core, is also problem solving. I approach all work with an equally analytical and creative mind with an intense attention to detail.</p>
            <P>I like to approach typical design processes with an emphasis on accessibility: Have we considered everyone's needs in this design? How does this solve our different users' problems better than other potential solutions?</P>
